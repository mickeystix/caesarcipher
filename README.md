# caesarcipher
I like weird things like ARGs - you know, those weird "real-life" games that are very common on platforms like YouTube, but spill into the real world.
A really common thing used in ARGs is very basic encryption, and there is nothing more simple than the Caesar Cipher

This small python file runs a tkinter GUI that allows you to encode or decode caesar ciphers.
